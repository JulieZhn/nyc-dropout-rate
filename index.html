            <p>Over the span of eleven years since 2010, the <a
                    href='https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=16#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20there%20were%202.0,to%205.2%20percent%20in%202021.'>national
                    high school dropout rate</a> has shown a consistent decline. In 2020, it stood at 8.3%, dropping
                notably
                to 5.2% in 2021. In 2018, the rate hit 5.3%, indicating substantial progress in retaining students and
                facilitating their attainment of high school diplomas.</p>\

            <p><a href="https://education.jhu.edu/directory/david-steiner-phd/">David Steiner</a>, a professor at the
                Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy, pointed out some dropout
                reasons from the broad picture. ‚ÄúThey (students who drop out from school) have missed too many days of
                school, and therefore they are pushed out. They are just getting very low grades, or they don't like the
                school board at school, and they just switch off.‚Äù

            <p>Picking a typical year during the period when nationwide high school dropout was decreasing, say, 2018,
                how
                was New York City doing at that time? Did its high school dropout rate surpass or fall below the
                national average? Overall, the city's dropout rate aligns closely with the national figure. However,
                Bronx
                County <a href="https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/academics/graduation-results">reported</a> a notably
                higher dropout rate of 7.8%, while Queens boasted the city's lowest rate at 4.1%.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Why is that? What are some factors related to the high school dropout rate in NYC? Being an English
                learner is a very common one. Steiner also gave an example of how hard an English language learner's
                (ELL) life can be. ‚ÄúIf you suddenly were dropped by your parents in a foreign country where you didn't
                speak the language, and you couldn't understand what was going on in school. You didn't know the
                customs,‚Äù said Steiner, ‚ÄúI mean, it is pretty tough, right?‚Äù
            </p>
            <p>Looking into the dropout data of ELL, former ELL, and non-ELL students in NYC, we found something
                interesting. The Bronx has the lowest ELL high school dropout rate but the highest former ELL and
                non-ELL dropout rate in NYC. That means compared to other EL students in the other four NYC counties,
                ELs in the Bronx are doing okay in schools, but students here who are former ELs and who are native
                English speakers are more likely to drop out from school compared to their counterparts in other
                counties. Plus, Manhattan has the highest dropout rate of EL students in NYC.

        <div class="content">
            <p>According to a study conducted by Fordham University, there are generally seven academic challenges of
                high school ELs, including 1) inadequate/poor academic preparation, 2)not able to pass NY State high
                school (Regents) tests required for graduation, 3)lack of English language proficiency, 4)difficulty in
                catching up content and language at the same time, 5)difficulty keeping up with the technical vocabulary
                and complex academic, 6)poor education prior to USA schooling, and 7) failing individual content area
                tests and course requirements.
            </p>
            <p>To help ELs improve their study, the research points out that teachers can overcome some instructional
                challenges by helping the students understand reading material, giving them sufficient time to complete
                tasks, making the class size smaller, giving them more mentoring, providing more classroom activities,
                helping them connect classroom content to real-life situations, and customizing instruction approaches
                to target different students. </p>
            <p>Another interesting finding here is that, across the five counties, former ELLs always have a lower
                dropout rate than non-ELLs. That means students who weren‚Äôt fluent in English but later gained
                proficiency are doing better than native English speakers in schools.
            </p>
            <p>Steiner explained that this is because former ELLs have been in adversity but now they've got a victory
                and they continue to work hard and they do well.
            </p>
            <p>‚ÄúIf they're going to drop out, they're going to drop out soon,‚Äù said Steiner, ‚ÄúIf they stick with it and
                they've got their inner strength, you know, they're not less capable than American students, obviously,
                and they do fine.‚Äù Steiner thinks it is just a question of overcoming the initial hurdles; after getting
                through the first couple of years, they can even do better than they do.
            </p>
            <p>Other than English languaging learning, being economically disadvantaged is another common reason for
                pulling students out of school. Poverty makes students fall into a dilemma if there is no appropriate
                family and life support to have a quiet space and enough time to study.
            </p>
            <p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say you have five siblings,‚Äù said Steiner, ‚Äúthere's no decent food on the table. You're sharing a
                space with six other people. There's no quiet place to work. None of your family has ever been past high
                school. They don't understand why you're not at home looking after your younger siblings, which is what
                they need you to be doing.‚Äù
            </p>
            <p>Steiner also points out that students who get a job to make money while they are in school could also
                lead them to have less time to focus on high school work.
            </p>
            <p>Data shows that the Bronx has the highest dropout rate of students who are economically disadvantaged,
                which Steiner found not to be surprising as the Bronx has a high poverty rate in NYC. However, the Bronx
                has the second-to-last lowest dropout rate of students who are not economically disadvantaged. That
                might mean when students are not in poverty in the Bronx, they actually are doing fine in school
                compared to other non-economically disadvantaged students in NYC.
            </p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Steiner also gave more interesting ideas of factors that can lead to dropout. He believes that people
                have gotten out of the habit of socialization, and so it's harder to be in school. Also, there is a lot
                of research that shows that big exposure to social media is a problem. It reduces attention spans, and
                makes it more difficult to focus in school and do the homework. So social media is clearly a
                contributor. Moreover, in the sense of isolation, if a student has the sense that no one cares whether
                he or she is at school or not, that's a big turnoff too.
            </p>
            <p>In a broader sense, Steiner brought up that the system doesn't create an incentive for hard work except
                for the elite, who are obviously trying to get into top schools.
            </p>
            <p>‚ÄúFor most of them (high school students), they would get B's, go to the state college or whatever it is,
                said Steiner, ‚ÄúBut there's not that sense. In most of the world, there's an immediate linkage between
                how well you do in school and whether you're going to go to college or not, or whether you're going to
                go into a good career.‚Äù
            </p>
            <p>Although some states are trying to challenge this issue, for example, Wisconsin announced that if a
                student is in the top 5% of his or her graduating high school, he or she would automatically go to the
                flagship university. However, ‚Äúin many states, there's no obvious link between, you know, exam
                performance and getting into college,‚Äù said Steiner. </p>
