# Unraveling Dropout Dynamics: Trends and Insights in New York City Education 📚👨🏻‍🎓👩🏽‍🎓🎒🏫✏️🎨
### This project seeks to deepen our understanding of how being an English Language Learner and facing economic disadvantages may impact the dropout rates in New York City, as well as exploring broader reasons for dropout rates across the nation.

From data analysis, here are **my findings**:

- Over the span of eleven years since 2010, the national high school dropout rate has shown a consistent decline. In 2020, it stood at 8.3%, dropping notably to 5.2% in 2021.
- Bronx County reported a notably higher dropout rate of 7.8%, while Queens boasted the city's lowest rate at 4.1%.
- Across the five NYC counties, former ELLs always have a lower dropout rate than non-ELLs.
- The Bronx has the highest dropout rate of students who are economically disadvantaged. However, the Bronx has the second-to-last lowest dropout rate of students who are not economically disadvantaged.

**Data Collection**:
National Center for Education Statistics, [Dropout Rates](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=16#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20there%20were%202.0,to%205.2%20percent%20in%202021)

NYC Public Schools InfoHubl, [Graduation Results](https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/academics/graduation-results)

**Data Analysis**:
I created several tabels with the columns I want from the big datasets, and then I put the table into Datawrapper to make the map and charts. 

**New Learnings**:
I enhanced my skills in dataset searching, data collection, data visualization with Datawrapper, and coding with HTML file to hold webpage.

**Improvements I could make**:
If I got more time, I might can find some more complete datasets with both nationwide and citywide data over the recent 10 years. I could also talk to more education experts in the city and NYC public school press office to get more city-specific information in education.
